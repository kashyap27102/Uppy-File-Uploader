# POC - Files Uploader Using Uppy

## Project Overview

The project utilizes Uppy, a sleek and modular file uploader for web applications. The project is divided into two main parts:

- **Client:** This directory contains nextjs web app
- **Companion Server:** This directory contains the server-side code, which helps to take away the complexity of authentication and the cost of downloading files from remote sources

## Key features of Uppy

- **Customizable UI:** You can customize the look and feel of Uppy to match your application's design.

- **Plugin System:** Uppyâ€™s functionality can be extended with a variety of plugins like Dashboard, Drag and Drop, File Input, Status bar, Informer, Thumbnail Generator

- **Multiple Source Integrations**: Local files,
  Remote URLs,
  Google Drive,
  Dropbox,
  OneDrive,

- **Preprocessing and Postprocessing**: Uppy allows you to define preprocessing and postprocessing steps for your files, such as image compression or format conversion.

- **Chunked Uploads:** For large files, Uppy can split them into smaller chunks, uploading them in parallel to improve performance and reliability.
